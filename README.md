# Jest project stuff

Jest ignores config and attempts to run all JS and JSON files as tests (ignoring the test config in the project folder) when only one project is specified in the `projects` array.

Repro:

0. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. Run `yarn jest`

```sh-session
$ yarn

yarn install v1.12.3

Interestingly, this project works if you change the `projects` field to also include `packages/b`:

```diff
-      "packages/a"
+      "packages/a",
+      "packages/b"
```

```sh-session
$ yarn jest

yarn run v1.12.3

The same issue occurs if `projects` is a wildcard:

```diff
-      "packages/a"
+      "packages/*"
```

```sh-session
$ yarn jest

yarn run v1.12.3
$ /Users/theneva/code/jest-project-stuff/node_modules/.bin/jest
 PASS   a  packages/a/test.js

```

If you then delete `packages/b` so `packages/*` resolves to a single project:

```
$ git status

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    packages/b/package.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
